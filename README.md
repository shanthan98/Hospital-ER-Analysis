# Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Data Analysis - Tableau Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard and hospital emergency room (ER) data analysis. The analysis focuses on patient demographics, satisfaction scores, wait times, and department referrals.

## Dataset

The data used for this analysis is stored in the file `Hospital ER.csv`. It contains the following fields:

- `date`: Timestamp of the ER visit.
- `patient_id`: Anonymized patient identifier.
- `patient_gender`: Gender of the patient (M/F).
- `patient_age`: Age of the patient at the time of the ER visit.
- `patient_sat_score`: Patient satisfaction score (1-10 scale).
- `patient_first_inital`: First initial of the patient's name.
- `patient_last_name`: Last name of the patient.
- `patient_race`: Patient's race or ethnicity.
- `patient_admin_flag`: Boolean flag indicating whether the patient was admitted to the hospital.
- `patient_waittime`: Time spent waiting before being seen (in minutes).
- `department_referral`: The department to which the patient was referred (e.g., Orthopedics, General Practice).

## Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard created for this project provides insights into:

- **Patient Demographics**: Gender, age, and race distribution.
- **Wait Times**: Analysis of wait times across different demographics and referral departments.
- **Patient Satisfaction**: Analysis of satisfaction scores in relation to wait times and referrals.
- **Department Referrals**: Breakdown of referrals by department.

### Key Insights:

1. **Wait Times**: Analyzed wait times based on patient demographics and referral departments.
2. **Satisfaction Scores**: Correlated satisfaction scores with patient wait times and other factors.
3. **Referral Departments**: Identified the departments receiving the most patient referrals and their associated wait times.

## Prerequisites

To view and interact with the Tableau dashboard, you'll need:

- **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public** (for visualization).
- **Python** (optional, for additional data cleaning or analysis).
